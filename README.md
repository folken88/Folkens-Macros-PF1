I wrote these macros for my blind players. They use them along with a mod called “Advanced Macros” to trigger skills, checks, and such from their character sheets via chat. Advanced-Macros also requires the mod “lib-wrapper” to function. 

I try to keep all the macros as short as possible, to speed up the play for these players. Below is a key of all the macros present. With a little experimentation, you can probably create some of your own! Whenever possible, I used the same abbreviation the pf1 system devs do for an item eg perception becomes per because that’s what they use.

Installation: 
Install the mod.
Turn the mod on (requires advanced-macros and lib-wrapper mods).
Look under compendiums for “Folken’s PF1 Blind Macros.” 
Right click it and left click “Import all content.” 

Try them out!


All macros are written to be character agnostic. Meaning they will run off the sheet of whatever actor you are currently assigned. If you’re GM, you need to have a token selected for them to work.

Items & Spells: For these they must be individually dragged down to the button bar, then renamed. They will be character-specific. 


Then right-click that macro in the bar and rename it to something simple to type. Eg Wand of Cure Light Wounds becomes wclw


That’s it! WIth these macros installed / created, your players can trigger them from a chat prompt as long as “Advanced Macros” mod is on. Anyone can use them, as long as they have an actor assigned or a token selected.

Some checks currently take your focus & cursor off the chat prompt. I’m working with the mod / fvtt devs to fix this! They are the real experts on this stuff!
